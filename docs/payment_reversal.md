# Payment Reversal

The Reversal API is used to reverse a successful transaction. Using the Transaction ID of a previously successful transaction,  the OpenAPI will withdraw the funds from the recipient partyâ€™s mobile money wallet and revert the funds to the mobile money wallet of the initiating party of the original transaction.

Use *payment_reversal()* method to reverse a transaction in pypesa, the most important thing to consider is the **output_TransactionID** of the previous transaction.

For instance if we take a look at json response of a previous b2b transaction we have done above illustrated below;

```python
{'output_ResponseCode': 'INS-0', 'output_ResponseDesc': 'Request processed successfully', 'output_TransactionID': '4iUThBRRWXMG', 'output_ConversationID': 'f3ca96e7cb7f473a847247d8b887b922', 'output_ThirdPartyConversationID': '8a89835c71f15e99396'}
```

 We can see the value of **output_TransactionID** to be **4iUThBRRWXMG**, Let's note that and use it reverse that transaction, If you had a different ID just do the same from json response of a transaction you would like to reverse;

## Example

 Our code to reverse it, would probably look like this;

```python
>> import pypesa
>> mpesa = pypesa()
>> transaction_query = {
      'input_ReversalAmount':10,
      'input_Country': 'TZN',
      'input_ServiceProviderCode': '000000',
      'input_ThirdPartyConversationID':'asvf7ba228d83d0d689761',
      'input_TransactionID':'4iUThBRRWXMG'
    }
>> mpesa.payment_reversal(transaction_query)

```
